# Autonomous Robots Data Visualization and Interface

This project aims to create and illustrate data visualizations for autonomous robots. In addition, interfacing and interacting with the robot via an interface will also be demonstrated in this repository. Primarily, visualizations will be done in ROS, Gazebo, and other robotics software. Visualizations will demonstrate the process in which an autnomous vehicle decides the best path to navigate. RRT* and A* algorithms are algorithms that are explored and visualized in this respective repo. Autoware simulator is also a potential building block later on. 

## Running the project
* Use the command `launch.sh -i elvishelvis/dsc180s2g3 -c 4 -m 8  -P Always` in order to have the necessary environment to run data processing, analysis, and visualization

## Building the project using `run.py`
* Use the command `python run.py data` to ...
* Use the command `python run.py eda` to ...
* Use the command `python run.py plot` to ...
* Use the command `python run.py test` to ...
* Use the command `python run.py all` to ...

### Contributions:
<b>Yuxi Luo</b> A14862234 <br />
Contributed to developing visualizations for RRT* and A* algorithms. Collected and cleaned data from alternative groups to enable visualization and interface development. Tested different ROSBAGS for data type compatibility. Investigated various forms of visualization from different ROS topics (diff sensors, camera, lidar, etc.). Helped in managing and updating Github repo.
